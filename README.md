# funpar_final-project

This GitHub repository is a school project for the course called "Functional and Parallel Programming".

We were tasked to choose a project which will imply writing an algorithm in parallel style.
We chose to test the limits of popular and lesser known sorting algorithms. The algorithms we chose were QuickSort, InsertionSort, SelectionSort, TreeSort, 
RadixSort and SampleSort.

In this GitHub repository we have shared with you our Scala project (all algorithms written in the Scala programming language), in which you will find a
Scala file for each algorithm.

We have also shared in this repository a report where you can read a quick summary of the results of our algorithms.

That's all, have a good day :)
